I would like to talk about contribution to OSS, especially with Go.

- 'Why' and 'Why Not' I contributed to OSS
- What I noticed about contribution to OSS
- What I got through the contribution to OSS

About a month ago, I modified OSS repository with Go for the first time. I realized some important points about contributing. So, from this experience, I would like to talk about what I noticed when I contributed, especially when I modified the Go code.
