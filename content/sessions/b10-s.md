While it is common to implement HTTP servers or proxies, there are probably few people who have ever implemented an HTTP-level tunnel.

HTTP Tunneling can be used in situations similar to the requirements of using a VPN, for example, to be able to access a localhost server from outside. 

In this talk, I will introduce specific implementation concepts to archive this. This talk will give audiences a deep knowledge of TCP and HTTP level implementation in Go. 

Two tunnel designs will be discussed.

1. HTTP Tunnel using HTTP method `CONNECT`
2. WebSocket HTTP tunneling

The following technical issues and solutions will be explained while showing Go code in touching on the above designs.

- Basic knowledge of TCP sessions and how to handle them in Go
- Packet transferring
- Periodic communication implementation of maintaining tunnel connection
- Design and implementation of WebSocket server and client
- Shutdown implementation to handle system signals
- ...etc

This talk will provide time to learn basic concepts not limited to Go, such as TCP, HTTP, WebSocket, etc..., as well as Go implementation under a little bit complex requirements at the intermediate level and above.
