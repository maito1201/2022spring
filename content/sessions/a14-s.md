I am now developing and operating microservices at Mercari, Inc., using Go as my primary development language.

I have started using Go for the first time since I started working at Mercari. To deepen my understanding of Go, I learned many things while participating in various Go communities.
I have got used to developing with Go. And leading the team's development, presenting at internal Go study sessions, and organizing "mercari.go", a Go study session as a meetup.

In this session, I will share how I have chosen to learn with the Go community, keeping in mind the pros and cons of each case based on my learning curve since I started learning Go.
